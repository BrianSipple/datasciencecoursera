Training Machine Learning Predictions on Fitness-Tracking Sensor Data

=================================================================================

# Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand (RIP Nike FuelBand), and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These types of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement (which in turn points to the larger emerging trend of wearable computing as a means of integrating technology with the flow of the world). 

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how WELL they do it. The goal of this analysis, therefore, is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and predict the manner in which an exercise was performed. 

The participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

The qualitative value of each exercise instance is stored in the traning set's "classe" variable.

## Pre-processing

Sound pre-processing often starts with removing NAs and setting the variables in the dataset to their appropriate classes -- so they can be computed on in the appropriate way.

First, we can manually remove a few variables that are obviously useless -- i.e., "X", "user_name", and "raw_timestamp" -- then we can get more clever.

```{r}

# remove some fluff

training = training[,-c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)]
testing = testing[, -c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)]

# turn classes of variables into their appropiate class by reasoning with their unique counts
countElem = apply(training, 2, function(x) { length(unique(x)) })

for (i in 1:(ncol(training)-1)) {
        if (countElem[i] > 10) { 
                training[,i] = as.numeric(training[,i]) 
                testing[,i] = as.numeric(testing[,i]) 
        }
}

# Remove variables that are all NAs in the test data set:
countNA = data.frame(training = apply(training, 2, function(x) { sum(is.na(x))}),
                     testing = apply(testing, 2, function(x) { sum(is.na(x))}) )

NAs = which(countNA$training != 0) 
NAs.test=which(countNA$testing != 0)

out = union(NAs, NAs.test)

training = training[,-out]
testing = testing[,-out]


# Split the data for k-folds cross-validation
set.seed(1)
library(caret)
folds = createFolds(y=training$classe, k=10, list=T, returnTrain = T)
pred = factor(rep("A", nrow(training)), levels=levels(training$classe))


# Use predictive algorithm random forest to train model and predict outcome for the k-folds

library(randomForest)
for (i in 1:length(folds)) {
        print(i)
        model = randomForest(classe~., data=training[folds[[i]], -1])
        pred[-folds[[i]]] = predict(model, training[-folds[[i]], -1])
}


# estimate misclassification error on the data set

missClass = sum(pred != training$classe) / nrow(training) * 100
missClass

# compute the mean and standard deviate of each misclassification error of the k-fold
missClassFold = c()
for (i in 1:length(folds)) {
        missClassFold = c(missClassFold, 
                          sum(pred[-folds[[i]]] != training$classe[-folds[[i]]]) /nrow(training) - length(folds[[i]]) * 100 )
}

mu = mean(missClassFold)
sdev = sd(missClassFold)


# We can form a 95% Confidence interval for the missclassification error
CI = [mu-2*sdev, mu+2*sdev]

#classify the test data:
testing$new_window = factor(testing$new_window, levels = c('no', 'yes'))

model = randomForest(class~. data = training[,-1])
answers = predict(model, testing[,-c(ncol(testing))])

# write down answers
pml_write_files = function(x) {
        n = length(x)
        for (i in 1:n) {
                filename = paste0("problem_id_", i, ".txt")
                write.table(x[i], file=filename, quote=F, row.names=F, col.names=F)
        }
}

mu-2*sdev
mu+2*sdev

pml_write_files(answers)
```

## Model Fitting

And now to fit our model. Given the extent to which we've already cleaned up our dataset, we should be able to take advantage of the the random forest classifier.

In addition to their high level of accuracy, random forests are perfect for data, considering the outcome variable was categorical and had 5 different levels - A, B, C, D and E. Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes output by individual trees.

```{r}


set.seed(1324)

modFit = train(classe~., method="rf", prox=T, data=training)

modFit


```

The accuracy that our model was able to obtain was 92.5%. Pretty good. Now that we have it fit, though, we need to use it to predict on our cross-validation set.

```{r}

crossValPredicts <- predict(modFit, crossVal[,-28])
crossValPredicts

```
For good measure, let's run it on the testing set as well

```{r}

testingPredicts = predict(modFit, testingData$classe)

```


## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the accuracy of the model is performed by applying the predcitions we made on the cross-validation set to a confusion matrix -- along with the actual "classe" values of said set

```{r}

# Evaluate Cross-Validation predictions
CVresults = confusionMatrix(crossVal$classe, crossValPredicts)
CVresults

# Evaluate predictions on the test set
testResults = confusionMatrix(testingData$classe, testingPredicts)
```



  






In this case -- alluding to the M.A. Hall Correlation-based Feature Subset Selection for Machine Learning, Department of CS, New Zealand, 1999 -- the designers of the test suggested that 
a key indicator metric in the data set might be
